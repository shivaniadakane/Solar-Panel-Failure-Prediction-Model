# Solar-Panel-Failure-Prediction-Model
Business Problem Statement: A company is facing issue to predict that solar panel is faulty or not, as it has millions of panels so to ease the prediction, they hire a Data Scientist who will build a Machine Learning Algorithm so that they can easily predict it is faulty or not within a short interval time and will reduce human labour too.
Business Objective:  Maximize the efficiency of Solar panel
Business Constraint: Minimize human labour
CRISP-ML(Q) Methodology is used:   
1)	Business Understanding
2)	Data Understanding
3)	Data Preparation
4)	Modeling
5)	Evaluation
6)	Deployment

Data Collection: The dataset is collected from a verified web source. It consists of 15 columns with millions of records.
Data Preparation: The data is sampled as it has millions of records and balanced it.
		     EDA and Visualization is done on the data for better understanding of data. 
		     The data is cleaned by using various pre-processing techniques.
		     Splitting the cleaned data into two sets - a training set and a testing set.
Model Building: The model is built on Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm.
Model Training: The prepared data is passed to the model to find patterns and make predictions.
Parameter Tuning: To improve the accuracy of model it is done.
Model Evaluation: To understand a performance of model by using different evaluation metrics.
Model Selection: The best fit model is selected by comparing the metrics of different models.
Deployment: The model is saved and deployment is done so that it is use in practical decision-making.
