# Solar-Panel-Failure-Prediction-Model
This repository contains a machine learning solution for predicting solar panel failures, developed to address the challenges faced by a company with millions of solar panels. The primary goal is to maximize the efficiency of solar panels while minimizing the need for human labor in identifying faulty panels.

Methodology
The project follows the CRISP-ML(Q) methodology:

Business Understanding: Clearly defining the problem and business objectives.

Data Understanding: Collection of a dataset from a verified web source with extensive records.
The dataset used in this project is sourced from a reliable web platform and comprises millions of records with 15 columns.

Data Preparation: Sampling and balancing of data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization for better understanding.
Cleaning the data through various pre-processing techniques.
Splitting the cleaned data into training and testing sets.
The data preparation phase involves several steps, including sampling, balancing, EDA, visualization, and cleaning using various pre-processing techniques. The final dataset is then split into training and testing sets.

Modeling: Development of a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm for accurate predictions.
The predictive model is constructed using a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm.

Model Training: 
The model is trained using the prepared dataset to identify patterns and make accurate predictions.

Parameter Tuning: 
Fine-tuning of model parameters is conducted to enhance prediction accuracy.

Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using diverse metrics.
Different evaluation metrics are utilized to comprehensively understand the model's performance.

Model Selection: 
The most suitable model is chosen based on a comparison of metrics across different models.

Deployment: Saving and deploying the model for practical decision-making.
The final model is saved and deployed to enable practical decision-making.
